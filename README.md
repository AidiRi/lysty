# What the application does

The Lysty app allows users to save lists of whatever products they wish to purchase.

This application allows you to view various products and add them to a list. The products are sold in specific stores and you can see which stores your products are sold in as well as the inventories of the stores.

At this time, the application is not currently being hosted on a website but we do plan to release it at a later date

**Requirements and Setup**

* Ruby version

This application uses Ruby version 2.6.

* Configuration

At this time, you will need to clone down the repository to begin using the application.

* Database creation

Lysty uses postgresql so you can run rails db:setup to migrate the seed data to your local database.

* Database initialization

You will need to use rails db:seed to seed your postgresql database with our current seed data.

**Using the application**

Once you have your database setup you can run rails s in your terminal to begin running your local server. You can then navigate to localhost:3000 and use the application.

Once we have deployed this application to a hosting service we will include a link to the website as well.
